        <h3>Where it Began</h3>
        <p>I found my passions pretty early in life. Starting back in highschool I knew exactly what career path I wanted to go down. Before I narrowed it down I explored many different options, but in the end it led me to where I was meant to be. I have always had a love for animation, and I always specifically loved watching anime.<br>Years of learning to play several instruments, compose and conduct music, working on my drawing skills, taking creative writing classes to learn to write stories, and getting certified in Design programs through college courses while in high school has led me to my dream profession. Being an animator is everything I could ever dream of.</p>

        <h3>What Drives Me</h3>
        <p>Always being the dreamer that I am, I have always wanted to have a variety of things. A big family, a farm and garden, to spend my days creating art, training dogs, and making things with my hands. I spent most of my work career within the walls of a hot kitchen working long hours, and still never able to save a reasonable amount of money. By the time taxes, bills, and expenses to live was done I had mere change left over. That's not a life I wish to keep living. Too tired to enjoy my hobbies and passions, or to even cook the meals I could barely afford. I want to LIVE life and enjoy time with my family and art. I can't do that working endless overtime for minimum wage. I mean, who can?</p>

        <h3>Where I See Myself in the Coming Years</h3>
        <p>I see myself working hard to complete my goals in life, making a good example for my newborn son, and making myself proud of who I am. Working on self love through reasonable sucess. I don't want anything unreasonable in life. I don't wish to be filthy rich, or have a giant mansion. I want to find peace in life and within myself.</p>

        <h3>Why Coding</h3>
        <p>In the coming years and in the economy we are in to not learn how to code honestly sounds silly. Almost everywhere and everything has code rooted into it somewhere, and it would be such a useful skill to have. Not to mention the pay difference from our normal entry level jobs offered to the average person. I aspire to be different, and to make my situation different. To find a remote postition and to be a part of the evolution of technology while having the time and energy to achieve my dreams sounds like a dream come true. I know it takes hard work but nothing good comes easy.</p>
