                <p>Hi! My name is Jaboris Person and I am 29 years old. I am from Dayton, OH and I currently am a Laboratory Manager in the healthcare field. I am currently enrolled at the Bloom Institute of Technology as a Full Stack Web Developer and I am excited to undertake this program. I wanted to join this program so that I can further my range in the professional world and becoming a web developer is a great way for me to challenge myself, learn a new skill, and maintain my work/life balance that I desire in life. I am looking forward to new projects and to new opportunities! </p>
