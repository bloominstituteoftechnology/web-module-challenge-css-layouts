        <h1>Early Years</h1>
        <p>
          I was born in 1996 in Salem Massachusetts to two first generation
          immigrants from Dominican Republic. I grew up in a large family, I had
          an older brother, sister, 2 younger sisters and a younger brother
        </p>

        <h1>Teenage Years</h1>
        <p>
          I spent most of my teenage years playing sports, video games, and
          hanging out with friends.I also focused on school a lot, I was in
          honors since sixth grade and when entering highschool I took on AP
          classes as well
        </p>

      <div class="adult-years">
        <h1>Adulthood</h1>
        <p>
          I graduated from highschool with honors and went to UMass Amherst,
          unfortunately I did not finish my diploma but I made some life long
          friends. After College, I began working at different restaurants as a
          bartender/server.

        <h1>programming</h1>
        <p>
          After being a bartender for so long I wanted to leave the service
          industry and get started on a career that would make me feel
          fulfilled. My brother pushed me to try coding, I took a few intro
          courses for Python, JavaScript, CSS, and HTML and since I had taken
          some coding courses in college I picked up on it quickly. Now I am
          studying at BloomTech to hopefully start my career in the tech
          world.
