My interested in computers started when I was 4 first watching my dad play diablo, from that point onwards I became obsessed.

As I grew older I maintained this passion, but never thought I had the brains to be a successful programmer

I began to realize I was my own worst enemy and from that point on I dedicated my life to programming.
