Task 1: Set up Project
New features of a project should occur in a new branch in the same repository. Follow these steps to set up and work on your project from Thursday:

 cd into your personal portfolio folder
 Create a new branch from <firstName-lastName>:
git checkout -b <firstName-lastName-day2> - OK

 Implement the project on your newly created <firstName-lastName-day2> branch, committing changes regularly.
 Push commits: git push origin <firstName-lastName-day2> - WIP

Task 2: Minimum Viable Product
Use the checklist below to guide your work today. Your final product should be presentable at mobile, tablet and a desktop-width. (Create 3 media queries)

 Insert a viewport meta tag into the head of the project with these html attributes: content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1" - DONE ALREADY

 Introduce max-width media queries into your project at 800px and 500px

 Add accessability features to your webpage
 
 Design should closely follow the mobile wireframe given for your chosen layout


Task 3: Stretch Goals
Once you finish the minimum viable project, work on any of the following stretch goals:

 Test your website at several breakpoints and refactor code as needed. A few common breakpoints are below:
 iPhone: 360×640
 Laptop: 1366×768
 Widescreen: 1920×1080
 Test your webpage's accessibility with a screen reader like this
 Start over with min-width media queries to get a feel for how a mobile first approach would be like. I recommend making a branch of all your content in a new folder named "mobile-first" to keep it separate
 Test your webpage's accessibility with a screen reader like this
