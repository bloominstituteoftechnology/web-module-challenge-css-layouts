      <p> We're no strangers to love You know the rules and so do I
        A full commitment's what I'm thinking of You wouldn't get this from any other guy
        I just wanna tell you how I'm feeling Gotta make you understand Never gonna give you up
        Never gonna let you down Never gonna run around and desert you Never gonna make you cry Never gonna say goodbye
        Never gonna tell a lie and hurt you

        We've known each other for so long Your heart's been aching, but
        You're too shy to say it Inside, we both know what's been going on
        We know the game and we're gonna play it And if you ask me how I'm feeling
        Don't tell me you're too blind to see Never gonna give you up
        Never gonna let you downNever gonna run around and desert you
        Never gonna make you cry Never gonna say goodbye
        Never gonna tell a lie and hurt you </p>
      <p>
        Never gonna give you up Never gonna let you down
        Never gonna run around and desert you Never gonna make you cry
        Never gonna say goodbye Never gonna tell a lie and hurt you Never gonna give, never gonna give
        Never gonna give, never gonna give We've known each other for so long
        Your heart's been aching, but
        You're too shy to say it
        Inside, we both know what's been going on
        We know the game and we're gonna play it

        I just wanna tell you how I'm feeling
        Gotta make you understand Never gonna give you up Never gonna let you down
        Never gonna run around and desert you Never gonna make you cry
        Never gonna say goodbye Never gonna tell a lie and hurt you Never gonna give you up
        Never gonna let you down Never gonna run around and desert you Never gonna make you cry
        Never gonna say goodbye Never gonna tell a lie and hurt you. </p>
