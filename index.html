          </p>This journey into web development for me has been unique. I strayed into a selling career very early on in life, though I pursed 
          college programs in Advertising and mass communication hoping to involve in business communications. My love for the selling job, 
          took me through over two decades of commendable exposure to various business related activites and in recent years  also took me deep into the emerging world of 
          e-commerce.</P>
                     
          <p>A great turnpoint in my career is now being facilitated by a quality mastery-based web development program 
          which is now helping in integrating all of my education, experience, skills, and above all, my passions to transform thoughts
           into realities on the web!. This mastery-based education lets me put my skills into action in solving the problems on hand efficiently 
          within the permissable window of time to develop the expected results.
